# The Parametric Headphone Hook

A headphone hook designed to slip onto the edge of a desk top or shelf board.

Provide the length of the head band (top part that sits on your skull and hangs on the hook), the thickness of the mounting target, and set a flag indicating if you want to leave some extra room for double-sided foamy tape (or Command strips) for mounting.
